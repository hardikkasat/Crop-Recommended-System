# Crop-Recommended-System
Developed a crop recommendation system that predicts the best crops to grow based on environmental factors like soil type, temperature, humidity, and rainfall. The system leverages machine learning models to provide data-driven recommendations for optimal crop yields. 
Tech Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn for building models, Matplotlib for data visualization, and GitHub for version control and collaboration.
